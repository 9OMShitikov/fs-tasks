CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindFUSE3.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "FUSE3", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "FUSE3" with any of
  the following names:

    FUSE3Config.cmake
    fuse3-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "FUSE3" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "FUSE3_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "FUSE3"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
